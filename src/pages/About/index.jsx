        <b>Bibliotheca</b> is a platform that molds the ideas and experiences of
        mature writers by contributing a space where they can excel and showcase
        themselves. It mainly focuses on incorporating works of different genres
        so that a person can witness them with just a click. This venture
        remains exclusively for the students of EMEA College of Arts and
        Science. We intend to open a door of innovation by stepping forward to
        the digital platform. Writers can publish their work through a digital
        setup which is seen as convenient in today's world.

        This blog comes up with an earnest collaboration with Connect EMEA.

        can be independent in all aspects. By combining with Bibliotheca Connect
        EMEA has opened a wide section of opportunities.
